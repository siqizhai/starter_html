            <img src="images/pets3.1.jpeg" width = "600" alt = "Niuniu is lying on a sofa">
            <p>Niuniu is a two years old ragdoll cat. She is very playful and active, and she enjoys spending time with her human companions, seeking attention, and even following them around the house.</p> 
            <P>Niuniu had a penchant for getting into delightful mischief, and their favorite game was chasing sunbeams that danced across the living room floor. When the sun dipped below the horizon, Niuniu would curl up on the windowsill, gazing at the stars with a look of wonder in their bright blue eyes.</P>

            <h2>Pudding Cat</h2>
            <img src="images/pets5.1.jpeg" width = "600" alt = "Pudding is lying on the blanket and looking at the camera">
            <p>Pudding is a 3 years old cat. While many cats eagerly await the chance to explore the great outdoors, Pudding is quite the opposite. She's an indoor enthusiast through and through. The idea of venturing beyond the comfort of her cozy home simply doesn't appeal to her. Pudding prefers to observe the world from behind a glass window, watching birds flutter by and leaves rustle in the breeze.</p> 
            <P>Despite her laid-back disposition and preference for indoor living, Pudding has an endearing way of making her presence known. When she's not napping or lounging, she enjoys curling up beside her human companion, demanding the occasional chin scratch or gentle petting. </P>
